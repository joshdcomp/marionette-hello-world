# Marionette Hello World
##File structure
- **/assets**: assets are the compiled forms of the files found in /tools. Should really just be left alone
- **/tools**: 'raw' or workable source files to be compiled via grunt or fontcustom to /assets. All work should be done here
-- /tools/js/vendors: third-party js libs
-- /tools/js/local: js files created specifically for this project
-- /tools/sass: sass framework for this project...figuring out the best way to structure this
-- /tools/fonts: the fontcustom build for the icons
